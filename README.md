# LeetCode Practice

Starting **July, 2019**, I am working on coding practices through the website [LeetCode.com](LeetCode.com). This repository stores all the code files I wrote while doing the exercise.
The main language I am using is `Java`. In the future, `Python` will also be practiced.

I am also doing some database related questions to improve my understanding and skill for writing `SQL` commands.
